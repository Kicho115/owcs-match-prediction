# owcs-match-prediction
A machine learning system that predicts the winner of custom 5v5 owcs matchups based on the statistical profiles of the ten participating players. Instead of relying on preexisting teams, the model constructs team-level representations from individual player metrics and learns strength differentials between two dynamically formed compositions.
